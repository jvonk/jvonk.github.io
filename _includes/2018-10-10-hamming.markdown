There are only a few tools we need to solve this problem. First of all, we can use basic techniques to find the Nth bit of a number M: counting the least significant bit as bit 0, the next bit as bit 1, etc., we can find the value of that bit through the expression

```cpp
int Nth_bit = (1 << N) & M;
```

In other words, we are shifting the number 1 left by N spaces, and then performing a binary AND on the resulting number with our original number, which will leave either a 1 in the Nth bit or a 0. So the first thing we have to do is find out the distance between each pair of numbers within the set of all numbers with B bits (0..2B-1).
We also know that 0 can be one of the numbers in the set, because if the minimum number in the set were N instead of 0, we could XOR N to each number in the set and they would still be the same distance apart. The limits on the problem are low enough that we can do a DFS, and as soon as we hit a solution we can output it and exit.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <iostream.h>
#define MAX (1 << 8 + 1)
#define NMAX 65
#define BMAX 10
#define DMAX 10

int nums[NMAX], dist[MAX][MAX];
int N, B, D, maxval;
FILE *in, *out;

void findgroups(int cur, int start) {
    int a, b, canuse;
    char ch;
    if (cur == N) {
        for (a = 0; a < cur; a++) {
            if (a % 10)
                fprintf(out, " ");
            fprintf(out, "%d", nums[a]);
            if (a % 10 == 9 || a == cur-1)
                fprintf(out, "\n");
        }
        exit(0);
    }
    for (a = start; a < maxval; a++) {
        canuse = 1;
        for (b = 0; b < cur; b++)
            if (dist[nums[b]][a] < D) {
                canuse = 0;
                break;
            }
        if (canuse) {
            nums[cur] = a;
            findgroups(cur+1, a+1);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    in = fopen("hamming.in", "r");
    out = fopen("hamming.out", "w");
    int a, b, c;
    fscanf(in, "%d%d%d", &N, &B, &D);
    maxval = (1 << B);
    for (a = 0; a < maxval; a++)
        for (b = 0; b < maxval; b++) {
            dist[a][b] = 0;
            for (c = 0; c < B; c++) 
                if (((1 << c) & a) != ((1 << c) & b))
                    dist[a][b]++;
        }
    nums[0] = 0;
    findgroups(1, 1);
    return 0;
}
```
