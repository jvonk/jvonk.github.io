Since there are only 15 feeds, and for each feed we can either give zero or one scopes of it, there are 215 possible 'feed mixtures' the cows can be fed, which is only 32,768. Therefore, try all combinations and pick which of the legal combinations uses the least number of feeds.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define MAXV 25
#define MAXF 15

int req[MAXV]; /* the vitamin requirements */
int numv; /* number of vitamins */

int feeds[MAXF][MAXV]; /* the vitamin within each feed */
int numf; /* number of feeds */

int best; /* the minimum number of feeds to use found thus far */
int bestf[MAXF]; /* the set */

int curf[MAXF]; /* the current set of feeds being considered */

void find_feed(int fcnt, int fid)
 { /* fcnt is the number of feeds in the current mixture,
      fid is the identifier of the first feed to try adding (last feed + 1) */
  int lv;

  /* check if the requirement has been met */
  for (lv = 0; lv < numv; lv++)
    if (req[lv] > 0) break; 
  if (lv >= numv)
   { /* all the requirements are met */
    /* we know this is better, since we wouldn't have checked it otherwise
       (see below) */
    best = fcnt;
    for (lv = 0; lv < best; lv++)
      bestf[lv] = curf[lv];
    return;
   }

  while (fid < numf && fcnt+1 < best)
   { /* try adding each feed to the mixture */
     /* the fcnt+1 < best ensures that we stop if there's no hope
	in finding a better solution than one found already */

    /* add the vitamins from this feed */
    for (lv = 0; lv < numv; lv++)
      req[lv] -= feeds[fid][lv]; 
    curf[fcnt] = fid; /* put it in the list */

    find_feed(fcnt+1, fid+1); 

    /* undo adding the vitamins */
    for (lv = 0; lv < numv; lv++)
      req[lv] += feeds[fid][lv];

    /* next feed */
    fid++;
   }
 }

int main(void) 
 {
  FILE *fin, *fout;
  int lv, lv2;

  fin = fopen("holstein.in", "r");
  fout = fopen("holstein.out", "w");
  assert(fin);
  assert(fout);

  fscanf (fin, "%d", &numv);
  for (lv = 0; lv < numv; lv++)
    fscanf (fin, "%d", &req[lv]);
  fscanf (fin, "%d", &numf);
  for (lv = 0; lv < numf; lv++)
    for (lv2 = 0; lv2 < numv; lv2++)
      fscanf (fin, "%d", &feeds[lv][lv2]);

  best = numf+1;
  find_feed(0, 0);

  fprintf (fout, "%i", best);
  for (lv = 0; lv < best; lv++) 
    fprintf (fout, " %i", bestf[lv]+1);
  fprintf (fout, "\n");
  return 0;
 }
```
