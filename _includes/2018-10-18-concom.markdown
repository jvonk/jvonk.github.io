The method used here to solve the problem is as follows. We keep track of which companies control which other companies, and every time we hear that so and so owns this much percent of so and so, we update our information.

The array "owns" keeps track of how much of company j is owned by company i, whether directly or via controlled companies. The array "controls" keeps track of which companies are controlled by which other companies.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define NCOM 101

int owns[NCOM][NCOM];        /* [i,j]: how much of j do i and its
                                controlled companies own? */
int controls[NCOM][NCOM];    /* [i, j]: does i control j? */

/* update info: now i controls j */
void
addcontroller(int i, int j)
{
    int k;

    if(controls[i][j])        /* already knew that */
        return;

    controls[i][j] = 1;

    /* now that i controls j, add to i's holdings everything from j */
    for(k=0; k<NCOM; k++)
        owns[i][k] += owns[j][k];

    /* record the fact that controllers of i now control j */
    for(k=0; k<NCOM; k++)
        if(controls[k][i])
            addcontroller(k, j);

    /* if i now controls more companies, record that fact */
    for(k=0; k<NCOM; k++)
        if(owns[i][k] > 50)
            addcontroller(i, k);
}

/* update info: i owns p% of j */
void
addowner(int i, int j, int p)
{
    int k;

    /* add p% of j to each controller of i */
    for(k=0; k<NCOM; k++)
        if(controls[k][i])
            owns[k][j] += p;

    /* look for new controllers of j */
    for(k=0; k<NCOM; k++)
        if(owns[k][j] > 50)
            addcontroller(k, j);
}

void
main(void)
{
    FILE *fin, *fout;
    int i, j, n, a, b, p;

    fin = fopen("concom.in", "r");
    fout = fopen("concom.out", "w");
    assert(fin != NULL && fout != NULL);

    for(i=0; i<NCOM; i++)
        controls[i][i] = 1;

    fscanf(fin, "%d", &n);
    for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
        fscanf(fin, "%d %d %d", &a, &b, &p);
        addowner(a, b, p);
    }

    for(i=0; i<NCOM; i++)
    for(j=0; j<NCOM; j++)
        if(i != j && controls[i][j])
            fprintf(fout, "%d %d\n", i, j);
    exit(0);
}
