We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to make n cents with the given coins. If we denote the value of the kth coin by c_k, then the recurrence is:

```none
nway(n, k) = no. of ways to make n cents with the first k types of coins
nway(n, k) = nway(n, k-1) + nway(n-c_k, k)
```

This just says the number of ways to make n cents with the first k coins is the number of ways to make n cents using the first k-1 coins (i.e., without using the kth coin) plus the number of ways to make n-c_k cents using the first k coins. For the second set of ways, we then add the kth coin to arrive at a total of n cents.

We keep track of the number of ways to total "n" cents in "nway", updating the array as we read the value of each coin.

```cpp
/*
PROG: money
ID: rsc001
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define MAXTOTAL 10000

long long nway[MAXTOTAL+1];

void
main(void)
{
	FILE *fin, *fout;
	int i, j, n, v, c;

	fin = fopen("money.in", "r");
	fout = fopen("money.out", "w");
	assert(fin != NULL && fout != NULL);

	fscanf(fin, "%d %d", &v, &n);

	nway[0] = 1;
	for(i=0; i<v; i++) {
		fscanf(fin, "%d", &c);

		for(j=c; j<=n; j++)
			nway[j] += nway[j-c];
	}

	fprintf(fout, "%lld\n", nway[n]);
}
```
