As there are only 101^3 = 1,030,301 ways to do this, try them all and pick the best.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

/* the goal ratio */
int goal[3];

/* the ratio of the feeds */
int ratios[3][3];

/* the best solution found so far */
int min;
int mloc[4]; /* amounts of ratio 1, 2, and 3, and the amount of ratio 4 prod */

/* the amount of each type of component in the feed */
int sum[3];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
 {
  FILE *fout, *fin;
  int lv, lv2, lv3; /* loop variables */
  int t, s; /* temporary variables */
  int gsum; /* the sum of the amounts of components in the goal mixture */

  if ((fin = fopen("ratios.in", "r")) == NULL)
   {
    perror ("fopen fin");
    exit(1);
   }
  if ((fout = fopen("ratios.out", "w")) == NULL)
   {
    perror ("fopen fout");
    exit(1);
   }

  /* read in data */
  fscanf (fin, "%d %d %d", &goal[0], &goal[1], &goal[2]);
  for (lv = 0; lv < 3; lv++)
    fscanf (fin, "%d %d %d", ratios[lv]+0, ratios[lv]+1, ratios[lv]+2);

  gsum = goal[0] + goal[1] + goal[2];

  min = 301; /* worst than possible = infinity */

  /* boundary case (this ensures gsum != 0) */
  if (gsum == 0)
   {
    fprintf (fout, "0 0 0 0\n");
    return 0;
   }

  for (lv = 0; lv < 100; lv++)
    for (lv2 = 0; lv2 < 100; lv2++)
     { /* for each amout of the first two types of mixtures */
      sum[0] = lv*ratios[0][0] + lv2*ratios[1][0];
      sum[1] = lv*ratios[0][1] + lv2*ratios[1][1];
      sum[2] = lv*ratios[0][2] + lv2*ratios[1][2];

When you combine multiples of mixtures, you can look at it as a multiplication of a matrix by a vector. For example, 8*(1:2:3) + 1*(3:7:1) + 5*(2:1:2) = (21:28:35) = 7*(3:4:5) can be seen as

```none
[ 1 3 2 ]   [ 8 ]            
[ 2 7 1 ] * [ 1 ] = 7 [3 4 5]
[ 3 1 2 ]   [ 5 ]           
```

The matrix and the goal ratio vector (3:4:5 in this case) are given; what we have to find is the multiple vector (8:1:5 in this case) and the proportionality costant (7 here). This is like solving a system of linear equations. We can write it as

```none
AX = kB.
```

Now, if we use Cramer's Rule, and let D = determinant of A, then

```none
X_1 = k D_1 / D
X_2 = k D_2 / D
X_3 = k D_3 / D,
```

Where D\_1 is the determinant of the matrix A with the 1st column is replaced by B, D\_2 is the determinant of the matrix A with the 2nd column is replaced by B, D\_3 is the determinant of the matrix A with the 3rd column is replaced by B. (see a Linear Algebra textbook on why this works.) ,P> We are looking for integral solutions. If D = 0, no solutions. Otherwise, let k = D, and then X\_1 = D\_1, etc. If these values (X\_1,X\_2,X\_3, \_and\_ k) all have a greatest common factor above 1, divide them all by that factor, as we are looking for the smallest possible solutions.
Now, if some of the numbers is greater than 100, we have not found a feasible solution, so we output 'NONE'. Otherwise, the triple (X\_1,X\_2,X\_3) is output, as well as the value k.
