This is a shortest path problem, where the nodes of the graph are board arrangements, and edges are transformations. There are 8! = 40,320 possible board arrangements, so the problem can be solved using breadth-first search (since all edges are of unit length.

Number the boards in increasing order lexicographically, so that indexing is simpler.

In order to simplify the calculations, walk the path backward (start at the ending arrangement given, find the minimum path to the initial configuration following reverse transformations). Then, walk backwards in the resulting tree to determine the path.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
