description: "Write a program that calculates the price a customer has to pay for a purchase, making optimal use of the special offers to make the price as low as possible. You are not allowed to add items, even if that would lower the price."
---

In a certain shop, each kind of product has an integer price. For example, the price of a flower is 2 zorkmids (z) and the price of a vase is 5z. In order to attract more customers, the shop introduces some special offers.

A special offer consists of one or more product items together for a reduced price, also an integer. Examples:

*   three flowers for 5z instead of 6z, or
*   two vases together with one flower for 10z instead of 12z.

Write a program that calculates the price a customer has to pay for a purchase, making optimal use of the special offers to make the price as low as possible. You are not allowed to add items, even if that would lower the price.

For the prices and offers given above, the (lowest) price for three flowers and two vases is 14z: two vases and one flower for the reduced price of 10z and two flowers for the regular price of 4z.

### PROGRAM NAME: shopping

### INPUT FORMAT

The input file has a set of offers followed by a purchase.

|**Line 1:**|s, the number of special offers, (0 <= s <= 99).|
|**Line 2..s+1:**|Each line describes an offer using several integers. The first integer is n (1 <= n <= 5), the number of products that are offered. The subsequent n pairs of integers c and k indicate that k items (1 <= k <= 5) with product code c (1 <= c <= 999) are part of the offer. The last number p on the line stands for the reduced price (1 <= p <= 9999). The reduced price of an offer is less than the sum of the regular prices.|
|**Line s+2:**|The first line contains the number b (0 <= b <= 5) of different kinds of products to be purchased.|
|**Line s+3..s+b+2:**|Each of the subsequent b lines contains three values: c, k, and p. The value c is the (unique) product code (1 <= c <= 999). The value k indicates how many items of this product are to be purchased (1 <= k <= 5). The value p is the regular price per item (1 <= p <= 999). At most 5\*5=25 items can be in the basket.|

### SAMPLE INPUT (file shopping.in)

```none
2 1 7 3 5 2 7 1 8 2 10 2 7 3 2 8 2 5
```

### OUTPUT FORMAT

A single line with one integer: the lowest possible price to be paid for the purchases.

### SAMPLE OUTPUT (file shopping.out)

```none
14
```

This is a shortest path problem. The goal is to find the shortest path from an empty basket to a basket containing the requested objects. Thus, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used.

The nodes in the graph correspond to baskets and the edges correspond to offers (purchasing a single item can be considered a degenerate offer). The length of an edge is the cost of the offer. For each item type, there can be between 0 and 5 inclusive objects of that type in the basket, for a total of 6^5 = 7,776 possible baskets.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. This way is easier to code, and for the test cases it runs for much less than 0.1 seconds.

We keep a five dimensional array sol (it's not that much, because its size is only 5\*5\*5\*5\*5\*sizeof(special_offer).) Each configuration of the dimensions sol\[a\]\[b\]\[c\]\[d\]\[e\] corresponds to having a products from the first kind, b products from the second kind, c from the third, etc.

Basically, the DP forumla is the following : sol\[a\]\[b\]\[c\]\[d\]\[e\]= min (a\*price\[1\]+b\*price\[2\]+c\*price\[3\]+d\*price\[4\]+e\*price\[5\], so\[k\].price+ sol\[a-so\[k\].prod\[1\].items\] \[b-so\[k\].prod\[2\].items\] \[c-so\[k\].prod\[3\].items\] \[d-so\[k\].prod\[4\].items\] \[e-so\[k\].prod\[5\].items\] ) where k changes from 1 to the number of special offers. Or, in other words, for each field of the array we check which is better :

\* Not to use any special offer
\* To use some special offer

It's very similliar to the knapsack problem. The complexity of this algorithm is O(5\*5\*5\*5\*5\*100)=O(312,500), which is quite acceptable.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

ifstream fin ("shopping.in");
ofstream fout("shopping.out");

struct special_offer {
    int n;
    int price;              // the price of that special offer
    struct product {        // for each product we have to keep :
        int id;             // the id of the product
        int items;          // how many items it includes
    } prod[6];
} so[100];                  // here the special offers are kept

int code[1000],             /* Each code is 'hashed' from its real value
                               to a smaller index.  Example :
			       If in the input we have code 111, 934, 55,
			       1, 66 we code them as 1,2,3,4,5. That is
			       kept in code[1000];
